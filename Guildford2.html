        The data represented in this graph was collected from  <a href="https://data.police.uk/data/">Surrey Police. </a> By visualisizing the crime rates through a bar graph we are able to identify trends of crime in the Guildford area. Firsly, we found that out of the 4 areas we investigate Guildford has the highest amount of crimes, with an average of 966 crimes per month. Similar to the other areas we found that the crime rates in the beginning of the year seems to be quite lower compared to ones in the middle of the year. We see that at the beginning of the year the crimes from January to April seems to be lower compared to the rest of the year. With January being the month with the lowest crime rate and September being the highest.
